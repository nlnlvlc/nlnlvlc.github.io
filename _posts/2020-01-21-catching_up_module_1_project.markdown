When I started the curriculum last month, I knew I would fall behind a bit. I was expecting a round of interviews during the first two weeks. I only expected to be a section or two behind, using the break to get caught up before the New Year. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.

Out of nowhere, life spiral out of my control and all my plans changed overnight. I had a lot of people waste a lot of my time over the first weeks as I felt my goal for a career change quickly edge further and further away. Once class was back in session, I tried catching up but all my energy was completely drained. At the end of the first week back, I was still 5 sections behind and needed to catch up, quick. None of the study group recordings were helpful, because they seemed to cover topics outside of the course scope. The weekend was coming, I knew the following week was Project Week, so I bunkered down and pushed through.

Luckily, I had previous experience in a lot of what was covered, so getting through them wasn't too difficult, though it did mean skipping labs to get where I needed to be. Before I even finished the sections, I joined in on the student run study groups for the Final Project for the module. I had absolutely no idea what was going on. When I had last checked the Final Project section, it didn't have **any** information on the project details and nothing had been announced in Slack. So I just listened. 

It didn't seem like anyone else had any better of a handle on the project than I had. They knew what files we would be using and they had starter code that known of could understand. It used a lot of imports, functions, techniques, and language that hadn't been in the Module, at all. How were we supposed to work on something if we didn't understand it? 

As the study group went on, I finally finished Section 10. It was time to move on to the project, with everyone else.

### Starting the Project
The project seemed simple enough, at first. And it was. The questions I wanted to ask seemed simple, but informative. The problem was how to go about it. Of course, being behind didn't help. A lot of the questions I probably would have had could have been answered in the weeks before. My resources in Learn seemed low. I spent most of my time on Stack Overflow and Google trying to find answers to issues that others in the cohort had brought up, but without a concrete answer.

Though I got to the project on Monday of Project Week, I didn't really get started until Thursday. As I tackled *Question 1*, everything began to come together. I found out how to do what I needed, but the long way. I spent ***A LOT*** of time (possibly more than I should have) slimming down the code. I planned on reusing a lot the code so I placed them into functions. Outside of the functions, everything seemed to work. Once they were made into functions, everything started to break. Error after error popped up. I'd look up a solution and see I did the same thing. I'd fix one thing and then I'd break another. Debugging wasn't new to me, but this was heavy.

By the time Sunday came around, I had started Q2 and expected to be done within a few hours. Then a few hours turned into the next day. Now, it's Tuesday, after Project Week finished, and I'm just now wrapping it all up. I'm tired and frankly just processing the project being done.

I'm looking forward to Module 2. Like Module 1, I have previous experience in the topics, so all should be well now that I can keep up. But for now, I'm tired and I'm exhausted.
