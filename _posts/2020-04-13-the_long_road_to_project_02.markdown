After a long and difficult Mod 01, the hope that I'd be able to get on track and keep up with Mod 02 was shining bright. The curriculum covered a lot of things I used in my day job. Stats was a familiar friend that didn't worry too much. My main focus was applying the familiarity of statistics to the python.

In Mod 01, my approach to tackling Python was to translate my JavaScript knowledge to a new language. When it came to learning the basics, that approach seemed more than enough. It was simple. When it came to tackling Mod 02, not so much. I've never had to use JavaScript too intensively, but definitely not like this. From the beginning of the module, it was clear that we were stepping away from creating simple visualizations to needing to explore different statistical models and exploring the various python libraries in more depth.

My previous experiences with statistics weren't simple. First I learned to do everything by hand. Then I moved to formulas in excel, which we pretty simple. then we moved on even further into statistical software, like SPSS. No matter how complex the tools I was working with became, one thing never changed: there were all self-contained. Learning to work SPSS wasn't easy but at least everything I needed was already in SPSS. Tackling something head on is a lot less intimidating when you know you just have to learn it once and get your own groove with what you're given. The new problem was that statistical modeling in python isn't as straightforward. The main difference: you have options.

As a UXer of almost 8 years, I'll be the first one to tell you that too many options is always a bad idea. It makes users feel overwhelmed. Users never feel like they truly understand what they're doing. And, like a kid in a candy shop, you're never quite sure where to start first.
