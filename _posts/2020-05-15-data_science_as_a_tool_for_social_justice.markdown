Data science has many usages and, in many cases, those usages tend to favor business. We think of a business case. We go about talking big data issues to monitor enterprise activity. We build models and find out new ways to innovate long-existing components of business operation like customer service, eCommerce recommendations, etc... But how often do we focus on data science as a tool for observing, predicting, and the correcting social injustice?

I chose this specific dataset, not because it was the most interesting or the most challenging, but because I believed analyzing data on Terry stops would be the most impactful. Being Black, one of the earliest lessons we are taught is what to do when, not if, we happen to stopped by police officers, no matter what we were doing leading up to the interaction. The lesson isn't taught to sow fear of police officers. It's taught because disproportionate amounts of people who look like me end up frisked, searched, convicted, arrested, jailed, and killed on far less reason than my non-Black counterparts. If you're darker than I am, the ratio becomes even more disproportionate. LGBTQ? Even higher. What could easily be dismissed as anectdotal is an everyday reality for people like me. But, when you look at the data, it tends to be entirely out of context.

We can see higher numbers of Black people committing murder, but without consideration for the evidence, location, jury, circumstance, or a history of predatory prosecutions, can we say that data is accurate? When New Jersey cities, for decades, pulled over more Black drivers than lived in those individual cities, did anyone stop to look at the numbers in context of the city demographics? The reason for the stop? Probable cause? Did anyone stop and ask what factors could be used to predict these stops?

In completing this project, I wanted to understand how we can use data science for social good to support our most vulnerable populations. What happens when we apply these skill sets to undo hundreds of years of injustice against the disabled, Black and Native populations, asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants, women, and the others who are promised equality to their fellow man while constantly being shown otherwise? Even more, I wanted to show how the conversations change when we have a say in how we analyze the data.
